 <h1>OUR WORK</h1>
 <h5>Our work is focused around 6 ambitious goals with people at the center</h5>
 <p>WWF’s work has evolved from saving species and landscapes to addressing the larger global threats and forces that impact them.
Recognizing that the problems facing our planet are increasingly more complex and urgent, we have refined the way in which we work around an
ambitious new strategy. </p>
<h5>Our new strategy put people at the center & organizes our work around 6 key areas:</h5>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Forests</p>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Marine</p>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Wild Life</p>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Fresh Water</p>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Climate</p>
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" height="20px" width="20px">
<p>Food</p>
<p>By linking these six areas in an integrated approach, we can better leverage our unique assets and direct
 all our resources to protecting vulnerable places, species and communities worldwide.</p>
<p>People are at the center of our work because together we can change the trajectory of the threats to nature,
 and help ensure nature’s ability to provide—for the sake of every living thing, including ourselves.</p>

<p>We work globally, with every sector, at every level</p>
<p>To accomplish our ambitious goals, we work to educate and influence people into making sustainable choices and decisions,
  including those who work in business and make decisions around the use of natural resources, and those who work in government and set policy
  that impacts nature.

  We work globally at every level—in the field and in the local community, from the halls of government to the global marketplace.
  One of WWF’s strengths is our ability to engage stakeholders—in business, civil society, and acad emia—in partnerships to devise
  innovative solutions to the issues that challenge us.
</p>
<p> Working together with 1.1 million supporters , WWF’s partners, projects and experts
   are making a difference in creating a healthy future for our planet.</p>
